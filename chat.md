# AI Interaction Summary

## AI Interaction Overview
- **Primary Tool:** ChatGPT (Cursor integrated GPT-5 Codex)
- **Roles:**
  - Brainstorming localized UX language tailored for Hong Kong students
  - Generating HTML/CSS/JS scaffolding for the web prototype
  - Iteratively enhancing interactive features (mood diary history, community sharing)
  - Providing copy suggestions in Traditional Chinese with local cultural context

## Prompting Details
1. **Prompt:** “Write me a WebAPP html prototype for this idea…”  
   **Response Summary:** Generated the initial multi-section landing page structure (hero, features, chatbot, mood tracker, resources, community, footer) in English. Served as the foundation for subsequent localization work.

2. **Prompt:** “Please change all language to Traditional Chinese for Hong Kong Students. Please update all language with local cultures.”  
   **Response Summary:** Converted every UI element to Traditional Chinese/Cantonese phrasing, introduced Hong Kong–specific resources, and localized chatbot copy. This ensured cultural relevance and alignment with the audience.

3. **Prompt:** “In the part of 心情記錄…備註/小日記…stored and trackable…button…shared to 匿名社群…”  
   **Response Summary:** Guided the creation of a persistent mood diary history with shareable entries. Added new UI controls, localStorage persistence, and community integration logic.

## Project Evolution
- The **first prompt** delivered a comprehensive starter layout, saving time on base structure and responsive styling.
- The **localization prompt** pushed the design from a generic prototype into a culturally grounded experience by incorporating Cantonese phrasing, Hong Kong helplines, university services, and lifestyle content.
- The **diary sharing request** led to a richer feature set: mood history cards, share-to-community flows, safe content sanitization, and new button styling. This iteration transformed the simple mood tracker into a diary/community bridge, matching user expectations for a reflective wellness tool.

Overall, each AI exchange layered new capabilities onto the prototype while keeping the development pace rapid and consistent with the project vision.
